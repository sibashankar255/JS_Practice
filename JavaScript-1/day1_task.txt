1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Introduction:
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) has been the backbone of communication on the web for decades.
 However, as web technologies and user expectations have evolved, the need for more efficient and
  optimized protocols has emerged. This led to the development of HTTP/2, an improved version of the
   traditional HTTP/1.1. In this blog post, we will explore the key differences 
   between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 and understand how HTTP/2 enhances web performance and user experience.

1.Multiplexing and Binary Protocol:
One of the significant improvements in HTTP/2 is the introduction of multiplexing. In HTTP/1.1,
 a client could send only one request at a time over a single TCP connection. HTTP/2, on the other hand,
  allows multiple requests and responses to be sent concurrently over a single connection.
   This eliminates the need for multiple connections and reduces latency, as requests can be processed
    in parallel. Additionally, HTTP/2 uses a binary protocol, which enhances parsing efficiency 
    compared to the text-based protocol used in HTTP/1.1.

2.Server Push:
HTTP/2 introduces server push, a feature that allows servers to proactively send additional resources to
 the client without waiting for a request. In HTTP/1.1, resources such as CSS files, JavaScript files, 
 and images needed to be explicitly requested by the client. With server push, the server can analyze 
 the initial request and preemptively push related resources to the client's cache. This reduces the 
 number of round trips and accelerates page load times.

3.Header Compression:
In HTTP/1.1, each request and response included headers that contained metadata about the message. 
These headers were sent with every request and response, leading to increased bandwidth consumption. 
HTTP/2 utilizes header compression using the HPACK algorithm, which significantly reduces overhead by 
compressing and encoding headers. This efficient header compression improves network utilization and 
reduces latency.

4.Prioritization and Dependency:
HTTP/2 introduces stream prioritization, allowing the client to specify the priority of different
 resources. This enables the server to prioritize the delivery of critical resources, ensuring that 
 important elements of a webpage are loaded first. HTTP/2 also supports dependency management, 
 where resources can depend on other resources. This allows for better optimization and efficient
  resource allocation, improving the overall performance of web applications.

5.Connection Reuse and Server Efficiency:
HTTP/1.1 had limitations regarding connection reuse. Once a request was completed, the connection would 
close, and subsequent requests would require establishing a new connection. In HTTP/2, the connection 
remains open even after a request is fulfilled, enabling subsequent requests to use the existing 
connection. This reduces connection setup time and improves server efficiency.

Conclusion:
HTTP/2 brings significant enhancements to web communication compared to its predecessor, HTTP/1.1.
 With features like multiplexing, server push, header compression, prioritization, and connection reuse,
  HTTP/2 offers improved performance, reduced latency, and enhanced user experience. Although HTTP/1.1 
  continues to be widely used, HTTP/2 has gained adoption and support from major web browsers and
   web servers, making it a promising protocol for the future of web communication.

As web technologies continue to evolve, understanding the differences between HTTP versions becomes
 crucial for web developers and network administrators. Adopting HTTP/2 can bring tangible benefits
  in terms of website speed, responsiveness, and overall user satisfaction, making it worth considering 
  for optimizing web applications in today's digital landscape.

2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Introduction:
In JavaScript, objects are a fundamental concept that allows developers to represent and manipulate 
complex data structures. Objects are versatile and powerful, serving as the building blocks for creating 
dynamic and flexible applications. In this blog post, we will explore the internal representation of 
objects in JavaScript, understand their key characteristics, and delve into how they work under the hood.

Objects: Key Concepts and Features:
In JavaScript, objects are composite values that store data and provide a way to organize related 
information. They are created using either object literals or the new keyword with constructor functions. 
Objects can have properties and methods, which are the essence of their behavior and functionality.

Properties and Methods:
Properties in JavaScript objects are key-value pairs, where the keys are strings or symbols and the 
values can be of any type. Properties can be accessed and modified using dot notation (object.property) 
or bracket notation (object['property']).

Methods, on the other hand, are functions that are associated with an object. They can be defined 
directly within the object or added dynamically to an existing object. Methods allow objects to 
encapsulate behavior and provide a way to interact with the object's data.

Object Internal Representation: Prototypes and the Prototype Chain:
One crucial aspect of objects in JavaScript is their internal representation through prototypes and the 
prototype chain. Each object has an internal link to another object called its prototype. When a 
property or method is accessed on an object, JavaScript looks for the property/method first within the 
object itself. If not found, it continues the search in the object's prototype and follows the prototype 
chain until the property/method is found or until the chain ends with the Object.prototype object.
This mechanism allows for inheritance in JavaScript, where objects can inherit properties and methods 
from their prototypes. Developers can create hierarchies of objects and utilize prototype-based 
inheritance to share functionality and avoid code duplication.

Object Creation and Memory Allocation:
In JavaScript, objects are created dynamically during runtime. When an object is created, memory is 
allocated for its properties and methods. The memory is managed by the JavaScript engine, which utilizes 
garbage collection to automatically free up memory when objects are no longer referenced.

Object Mutability and Property Manipulation:
One important characteristic of objects in JavaScript is their mutability. Once an object is created, 
its properties can be added, modified, or deleted. This flexibility allows for dynamic changes to the 
object's structure and behavior.

However, it's important to note that some objects in JavaScript, such as built-in objects like Math or 
Date, are immutable and cannot be modified. These objects provide predefined functionality and cannot 
have new properties added or existing properties altered.

Object Cloning and Deep Copy:
JavaScript provides several techniques for cloning objects. Shallow cloning creates a new object with 
the same properties as the original object, but the properties themselves are not cloned. Deep cloning, 
on the other hand, creates a completely independent copy of an object, including all nested objects and 
their properties.
It's essential to understand the difference between shallow and deep cloning, as well as the impact on 
memory and object references when working with complex data structures.

Conclusion:
Objects are a cornerstone of JavaScript, enabling developers to represent and manipulate data in a 
flexible and powerful manner. Understanding the internal representation of objects, their prototypes, 
and the prototype chain allows for effective use of inheritance and code reuse. Moreover, being aware 
of object mutability, property manipulation, and object cloning techniques empowers developers to work 
with objects efficiently and make the most out of JavaScript's versatile nature.

By grasping the intricacies of objects and their internal representation, JavaScript developers can 
unlock the full potential of the language and build robust and dynamic applications with ease.

Introduction:
In the world of JavaScript, the document and window objects play vital roles in web development. 
Both objects are essential for manipulating and interacting with web pages. In this blog post, we will 
delve into the differences between the document and window objects, understand their unique 
characteristics, and explore how they contribute to the functionality of web applications.

The document Object:
The document object represents the web page or HTML document loaded in the browser. It serves as an 
interface to access and manipulate various elements and contents within the document. The document 
object provides a wide range of properties and methods for querying and modifying elements, handling 
events, and manipulating the structure and style of the document.

Key Features of the document Object:

DOM Manipulation: The document object allows developers to access and modify elements, attributes, and 
content within the HTML document using methods like getElementById(), querySelector(), createElement(), 
and many more.

Content Modification: With the document object, you can dynamically create, modify, and remove elements 
and their content, enabling dynamic web page updates.
Styling: The document object provides methods to change the style and appearance of elements, such as 
getElementById().style, enabling dynamic CSS manipulation.
Event Handling: The document object enables event registration and handling for user interactions, 
allowing developers to respond to events like clicks, keypresses, or form submissions.
The window Object:
The window object represents the browser window or tab in which the web page is loaded. It serves as the 
global object in the browser environment, providing access to various properties, methods, and features 
related to the browser window. The window object acts as a container for multiple objects and 
functionalities, including the document object.

Key Features of the window Object:

Global Scope: Variables and functions defined in the global scope are attached to the window object, 
making them accessible throughout the web page.
Browser Control: The window object provides methods for controlling browser behavior, such as navigating
 to different URLs (window.location), opening new windows (window.open()), and controlling the size and 
 position of windows.
Timers and Intervals: JavaScript features like setTimeout() and setInterval() are part of the window 
object, allowing the execution of code after a specified delay or at regular intervals.
Communication between Windows: The window object enables communication between different windows or 
iframes using methods like window.postMessage(), facilitating seamless interaction in complex web 
applications.
Differences and Relationship:
The document object is a property of the window object. While the window object represents the browser 
window or tab, the document object represents the loaded HTML document within that window. In other 
words, the window object provides access to the browser functionality, whereas the document object 
focuses on the specific HTML document loaded in the window.

Conclusion:
The document and window objects are integral components of JavaScript web development, each with its 
own unique purpose and functionalities. While the document object allows manipulation and interaction 
with the loaded HTML document, the window object provides access to broader browser features and controls.
